    <h4>Why are snaps good for Go projects?</h4>
    Go doesn't offer a method for delivering app updates to end users, and you're on your own when it comes to showcasing your project. Snaps offer a way to fill these gaps.
    <ul>
      <li>Snaps are easy to discover and install, with millions installing from the Snap Store every day.</li>
      <li>They auto-update, ensuring users always have the latest stable version of your app.</li>
      <li>And they're reliable, rolling back on failure while preserving your app's versioned data.</li>
    </ul>
